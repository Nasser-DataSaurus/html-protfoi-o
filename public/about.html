<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an Industrial Engineering graduate with strong experience in supply chain planning, data analysis, 
  and process optimization. Currently working as an Assistant Planning Manager – Supply Chain Promotions at Panda 
  (Savola Group), I lead cross-functional projects that ensure promotional cycles are executed on time and aligned 
  with business objectives.
</p>

<p>
  I specialize in <strong>data-driven decision-making</strong> through <strong>Power BI dashboards</strong>, 
  <strong>Python automation</strong>, and workflow optimization. I’ve developed tools that forecast demand, calculate 
  optimal order quantities, and track KPIs across hundreds of stores and SKUs — reducing stockouts and improving efficiency. 
  My work often focuses on turning raw data into clear, actionable insights that improve performance at scale.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond analytics, I excel in <strong>leading projects</strong> and guiding teams through new system implementations, 
  process standardization, and continuous improvement initiatives. From deploying automation workflows to authoring SOPs 
  and SLAs, I aim to make operations more sustainable, measurable, and effective.
</p>

<p>
  I am passionate about using technology and data to solve real-world business problems. Whether it’s optimizing supply 
  chain performance, automating routine tasks, or delivering insights through BI tools, I thrive on projects that bring 
  measurable results and lasting improvements.
